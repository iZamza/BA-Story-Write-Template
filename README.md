# User Story Template ✍
- 🔥 When creating a story, use the template **SBA Story Writing** (the template will be chosen automatically for Issue Type = Story New).
- 🔥 Please use the exact same structure, spacing/tabulation and formatting.
- 🔥 Sections **Business Value, Description, Acceptance Criteria** are mandatory.
- 🔥 Sections without content could be removed for better readability, or **'n/a'** mark could be added in those.

Short, informative header.
### 💰 Business Value ⭐
The section answers the questions:
- What functionality is needed to be done?
- Who needs this functionality?
- Why do they need it? And how critical is it for business?
You can use well-known template ‘As a… I want / I suggest… So that / In order to...’ or put it as free text. You also can add any additional meaningful info here, e.g. when the business case occurs, or why workaround doesn't work.
